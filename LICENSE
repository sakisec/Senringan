Saki Default License (SDL) v1.0
Copyright (c) [2025] Saki

Definitions
-----------
"Program" means the original work and any derivative works based on it, including source code,
binaries, installers, documentation, and other materials distributed with or derived from the
original work.

"Distribute" means any transfer, publication, delivery, or making available of the Program to
any third party, whether for free or for a fee, including via download, hosting, physical media,
app stores, marketplaces, or other distribution channels.

"Resell" means offering the Program, or any portion or derivative of it, for sale, for a fee,
or as part of a product or service for which end-users pay directly or indirectly (including
subscription fees, one-time purchase, or charging for access), but does not prohibit charging
for custom development, hosting, or support services provided the Program itself is provided
under the terms of this license and attribution requirements are met.

License Grant
-------------
Subject to the conditions below, Saki grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
revocable (as provided below) license to:
  • Use, copy, run, and display the Program.
  • Modify the Program and distribute such modified versions under the conditions below.

Conditions and Restrictions
---------------------------
1. No Resale. You **may not resell** the Program or any derivative work of the Program.
   - You may not offer the Program (original or modified) for direct or indirect purchase,
     subscription, or other monetization where the primary purpose is selling the Program itself.
   - This restriction does not prevent offering paid services (development, customization,
     integration, hosting, or support) so long as the Program is supplied to recipients under
     this license and not sold as a standalone commercial product.

2. Attribution and Credit Preservation. All copies and distributions of the Program, whether
   in original or modified form, must include a visible, unmodified attribution notice that
   credits "Saki" as the original author/owner. The attribution must:
   - Appear in a prominent place appropriate to the medium (for software: in a file named
     `NOTICE`, in the documentation, and in any about/help screens; for web/apps: in an
     about page or credits page; for binaries: in an attached documentation file or installer).
   - Not be removed, altered, or obscured. If you provide a modified version, you must add
     a note that you modified the Program and include your name, but you may not remove or
     alter the original "Saki" credit.

3. Sublicensing. You may not sublicense the Program in a way that permits resale or removes
   the attribution requirement. Any downstream recipient receives the Program under the
   same restrictions and must be informed of these terms.

4. Notices. If the Program contains a `NOTICE` file or other attribution file, that file must
   be included in any distribution and may not be changed in a way that removes the required
   credits to Saki.

Redistribution of Modified Versions
-----------------------------------
You may redistribute modified versions provided:
  • You obey the No Resale and Attribution and Credit Preservation terms above;
  • You include a clear changelog or description of modifications; and
  • You include this license text or a copy thereof with the distributed files.

Termination
-----------
This license and the rights granted herein terminate automatically if you fail to comply with
any of its terms. Upon termination you must cease distribution and use of the Program and
destroy or return all copies in your possession.

Disclaimer of Warranty
----------------------
The Program is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including
but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
non-infringement.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------
In no event shall Saki be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action
of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Program or the
use or other dealings in the Program.

Governing Law
-------------
This license is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of Saki's residence at the time of
copyright (unless otherwise specified in a separate written agreement).
